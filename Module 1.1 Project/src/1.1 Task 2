Supermarket as an example:
A supermarket has variability like customer arrival times,  number of items per basket,
cashier speed and item restocking.
It is also complex involving multiple checkout lines, self-checkout vs staffed counters, inventory and promotions, which affect demand.
A market also has a lot of delays which affect customer satisfaction.
